“Fairness-Aware Language Models: Real-Time Bias Detection and Mitigation through Reinforcement Learning”
1. Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing but often perpetuate and amplify social biases present in training data, posing ethical and societal challenges. This paper proposes a novel framework for real-time bias detection and dynamic mitigation in transformer-based language models using reinforcement learning. Our approach integrates a bias detection module that continuously monitors generated outputs for multiple dimensions of bias, including gender, race, and ethnicity, leveraging lexical and contextual classifiers. Upon bias detection, a dynamic parameter adjustment engine modifies the model’s attention weights and decoding probabilities to mitigate biased content without compromising fluency or relevance. We further incorporate customizable fairness profiles and user feedback loops to adapt mitigation strategies to specific contexts and demographics. Extensive experiments on benchmark fairness datasets demonstrate that our method significantly reduces bias metrics while maintaining state-of-the-art language generation quality. Additionally, an explainability interface provides transparency into bias detection and mitigation decisions, enhancing trustworthiness. This work advances fairness in NLP by enabling adaptive, interpretable, and context-aware bias mitigation during inference, suitable for deployment in sensitive applications such as healthcare, recruitment, and content moderation.
